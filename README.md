# MountainCar-v0-Reinforcement-Learning-Project
This project implements Q-learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm, to solve the classic MountainCar-v0 environment provided by the gymnasium library. The goal of the agent is to drive an underpowered car up a steep hill by building momentum through strategic actions.
